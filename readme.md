# Domineering - Online Two-Player Strategy Game

## 1. Introduction
Domineering is a classic abstract strategy board game played on a rectangular grid. The game is also known as Crosscram or Stop-Gate in some regions. Players take turns placing dominoes (2Ã—1 tiles) on the board - one player places them vertically, while the other places them horizontally.

The objective is simple: be the last player to make a legal move. When a player cannot place a domino, they lose the game. This creates an engaging battle of spatial reasoning and forward planning.

This implementation provides an online platform for two players to compete against each other in a turn based system, with a clean interface and automatic rule enforcement.
